I combined Vareational Autoencoder/decoder with GAN net to generate pictures from given images of faces. 
Vareational Autoencoder is trained on given dataset of image faces. However the GAN combination is trained 
on random generated vectors in a shape of images. After I trained Vareational Autoencoder, then I used VAE 
as a generator in the GAN architecture. During the training of GAN the Encoder part of VAE is untrainable. 
Only the Decoder part was trained in GAN Training.
