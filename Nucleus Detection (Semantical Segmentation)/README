The identification of cell nuclei is the starting point for significant number of researches. Most of the 30 trillion cells 
in the human body contain a nucleus that storing the DNA of the genetic code that programs each cell. Nucleus identification 
allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample. This lets to measure how cells respond to different treatments.

The goal of this project is to train and build model that capable accurately identify and semanticaly segment nuclei of cells 
on medical images.
