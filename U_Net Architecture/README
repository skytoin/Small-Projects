Here you can find legendary U_Net Architecture code. 

The typical use of convolutional networks is on classification tasks, where
the output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks,
especially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include
localization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. 
Moreover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks

The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture
context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. 
This network can be trained end-to-end from very few images
